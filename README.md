# Pathways Platform

# Development
This platform is built using Laravel/PHP. The front-end is written in VueJS and the admin panel uses Backpack for Laravel.

## Setup Local Environment
1.	Clone repo: `git@github.com:stats4sd/pathways_platform.git`
2.	Copy `.env.example` as a new file and call it `.env`
3.	Update variables in `.env` file to match your local environment:
    1.	Check APP_URL is correct
    2.	Update DB_DATABASE (name of the local MySQL database to use), DB_USERNAME (local MySQL username) and DB_PASSWORD (local MySQL password)
4.	Create a local MySQL database with the same name used in the `.env` file
5.	Run the following setup commands in the root project folder:
```
    composer install
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan backpack:install
    php artisan telescope:publish
    php artisan updatesql
    npm install
    npm run dev
```
6.	Migrate the database: `php aritsan migrate`
